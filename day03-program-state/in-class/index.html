          guess wrongly in between their two correct guesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each guess, output all information such as the guessed word, the
          secret word, and how many correct guesses the player still needs until
          she wins.

      <div class="instructions-text">
        <p>
          Create a new version of our Coding Basics dice game (where the player
          guesses the dice roll) that randomly becomes easier or harder. At the
          beginning of the game and each time the player wins, the computer
          selects a random number from 1 to 3, which we call the "within
          number". If any of the player's guesses fall within the dice roll plus
          or minus the within number, the player wins.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example: the app randomly chooses 3 as the within number. The
          player can guess within 3 of the dice roll to win the game. The player
          guesses 2 and the dice roll is 5. The guess is within 3 of the dice
          roll so the player wins the game. At this point, the computer adjusts
          the difficulty of the game by choosing a new within number.
