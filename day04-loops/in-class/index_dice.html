          <li>The game will have 2 modes.</li>
          <li>
            In the 1st mode, the user will enter the number of dice they wish to
            roll.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the 2nd mode, the user will enter a guess that will apply to all
            dice rolls. For example, if the user has chosen to roll 2 dice in
            Mode 1 and guesses 4 in Mode 2, that guess of 4 will apply to both
            Dice 1 and Dice 2.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the user guesses, the program will run a loop where the number
            of iterations is the number of dice rolls from Mode 1. Each loop
            iteration will roll a dice and verify if the user has won.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the user guesses correctly for any of the dice rolls, the user
            wins.
