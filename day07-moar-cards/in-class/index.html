<!--  All HTML files begin with the following line: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This indicates that the rest of the lines that follow are to be interpreted as HTML. It tells the browser about what document type to expect. -->

<!-- All text enclosed in angled brackets are known as HTML element tags. There are usually, but not always, starting and closing element "tags", each representing a HTML element.
The <html> element is known as the root element of a HTML page. All other elements are encased within it. -->
<html>
  <!-- The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page, information that is not rendered or displayed by the browser -->
  <head>
    <!-- The meta tag defines meta information in the HTML document. In this case, we are defining the charset. UTF-8 allows us to use emojis in the CodeSandbox environment -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!-- The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab) and is the default name given to a bookmark of a webpage. -->
    <title>Basics</title>
    <!-- The <link> element specifies a relationship between this HTML page and an external resource, namely the styles.css file here. For the syntax '../../' in '../../styles.css', we are referring to the styles.css file (in the main directory) found 2 folders above the current one. In this case, we are linking a stylesheet which is a CSS file containing information relating to the layout and style of the webpage. The syntax within the styles.css file is also referred to as CSS - Cascading Style Sheets. -->

    <nav>
      <!-- The <ul> tag represents an unordered list, where items in the list are rendered on a vertical bulleted list. While we are listing the days of the exercises on this navbar, we are positioning them horizontally without the bullets.
